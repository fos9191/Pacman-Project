## Project for Fundamentals of A.I. (Part 1) - module taken at KU Leuven
The objective of part 1 of the project was to implement the following algorithms along with some heuristics.

*Depth-first search
*Breadth-first search
*A* search (also creating the heuristic)

The only files that were changed are search.py and searchAgents.py. Everything else was provided.
